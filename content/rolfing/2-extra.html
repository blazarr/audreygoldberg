<h2>Rolfing® Structural integration and Rolf Movement Integration®</h2>
<div class="normal-text">
    <p>Rolfing® Structural Integration is a form of bodywork that alleviates stress and tension in the fascia, or connective tissue, that is continuous throughout the body. Rolfing® addresses the root cause of pain, discomfort, and/or lack of mobility by addressing the body as a whole system rather than separate parts. It can restore organization and balance, offering long-lasting efficient and easeful movement.</p>
    <p>As we move through life, we develop patterns of movement- through repetitive gestures, acute and chronic injuries, intentional training. The body as a whole is effected by these patterns as we compensate and continue to move through pain and misalignment. Rolfing® views the body as a system of moving parts that are all connected and related. Often a source of pain is not the place we experience the pain. For example, when a person comes in with knee pain, I take all parts into account- hip, ankle, and foot balance, the muscle compartments that attach and pull on the knee, old injury, repetitive strain patterns, etc... Imbalance could be in one or more of these areas and when those are balanced, the knee will no longer be strained and in pain.</p>
    <p>Rolf Movement® Integration focuses on client awareness and useful tools to work with the patterns of strain and asymmetry that an individual faces. By bringing attention to inefficient and detrimental patterns of movement, people can actively participate in changing the patterns and reinforcing the retraining that we do in sessions.  With greater awareness in everyday movements people are less likely to become injured and upon injury, find quicker recovery time.</p>
    <p>The hands on fascial work of Rolfing SI coupled with Rolf movement principles is a powerful combination to change posture and alignment while reinforcing the change with new ways of relating to one’s body. </p>
