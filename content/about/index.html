<div class="normal-text"> 
<p>I graduated from the Rolf Institute® of Structural Integration (RISI) in Boulder, Colorado as a Certified Rolfer™ in 2008. In 2010, my Rolf Movement® certification was completed.  Additionally, I have studied CranioSacral and Sourcepoint therapies to compliment and enhance my Rolfing sessions. I have attended workshops for Continuum, breath work and sound healing.</p>
<p>Prior to attending RISI, I earned a B.A. in Outdoor Experiential Education and Environmental Studies from Prescott College and became a certified yoga instructor at Yoga Shala in Prescott, Arizona. I worked as a backpacking, climbing, and river guide 3 seasons a year in Colorado, Alaska, Arizona and California. Winters were spent ski patrolling in the Sierra Nevada, California.</p>
